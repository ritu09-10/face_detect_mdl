# Face Detection Model

This repository contains a deep learning-based face detection model implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset to detect faces and predict their bounding boxes.

## Features
- Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for face detection.
- Detects faces in images and returns bounding box coordinates.
- Implements real-time face detection (if running on a local system).
- Supports training and inference on **Google Colab** and **Jupyter Notebook**.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection-model.git
   cd face-detection-model
2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. (Optional) Enable GPU acceleration for better performance.

Dataset
Ensure that your dataset is correctly structured and preprocessed. The model expects images of size 224x224 with three color channels.

Training
To train the model, run:

python
Copy
Edit
hist = facetracker.fit(dataset, epochs=40, validation_data=val_dataset, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
Make sure that:

The dataset is properly defined and loaded.

The model is compiled before training.

Inference
For making predictions, use:

python
Copy
Edit
yhat = facetracker.predict(test_sample)
Ensure that the input shape matches the expected dimensions (224, 224, 3).

Troubleshooting
If using Google Colab, ensure that the dataset is correctly uploaded.

Check for mismatched input dimensions if an error occurs.

If running on Colab, note that direct webcam access is not supported.
