# Face Detection Model

This repository contains a deep learning-based face detection model implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset to detect faces and predict their bounding boxes.

## Features
- Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for face detection.
- Detects faces in images and returns bounding box coordinates.
- Implements real-time face detection (if running on a local system).
- Supports training and inference on **Google Colab** and **Jupyter Notebook**.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection-model.git
   cd face-detection-model
